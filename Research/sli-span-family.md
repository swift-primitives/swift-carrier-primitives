## Context

Swift 6 introduces the span family (SE-0447 `Span<Element>`, SE-0467 `MutableSpan<Element>`, plus `RawSpan` / `MutableRawSpan`) as `~Escapable` contiguous-memory views. Copyable, `~Escapable`. These fit Carrier's Q3 quadrant (Copyable × `~Escapable`). Should any conform to `Carrier`?

## Analysis

### Structural match

`Span<Element>` is Copyable and `~Escapable`. The generic self-carrier form is viable:

```swift
extension Span: Carrier {
    public typealias Underlying = Span<Element>
    // The default extension provides getter + init, BUT the default
    // is written for Escapable types (omits @_lifetime annotations).
    // For ~Escapable Self, the default's `_read { yield self }` may or
    // may not pass the @_lifetime(borrow self) requirement on the
    // protocol; needs verification.
}
```

### Semantic fit

Span IS a value carrier in a defensible sense — `Span<Int>` carries a `Span<Int>` (itself). The `~Escapable` shape matches Carrier's Q3 quadrant structurally. Form-D generic algorithms (`describe<C: Carrier & ~Copyable & ~Escapable>(_ c: borrowing C)`) would work on Span.

### Why skip

1. **Verification cost.** The trivial-self-carrier default extension uses `_read { yield self }` without `@_lifetime(borrow self)`. Whether this satisfies the protocol's `@_lifetime(borrow self) borrowing get` requirement for `~Escapable` Self is unverified; it might compile but produce wrong lifetime semantics at consumer call sites. Would need bespoke conformance with explicit `@_lifetime` annotations per span type — not a one-liner.

2. **Generic type wrinkle.** Span takes a `Pointee: ~Copyable & ~Escapable` parameter (analogous to Array's Element). Parametric Carrier shapes ("Span of a Carrier Pointee") have the same Array-family complications (see `sli-array.md`).

3. **Conformance would require explicit bodies.** The trivial-self-carrier default likely can't cover Span safely; each Span variant would need its own extension with `@_lifetime` annotations. Four types × explicit bodies is higher effort than the Copyable SLI conformances (one-liner each).

4. **Single-conformance lock.** Shipping `Span<Element>: Carrier` centrally forbids consumer-declared parametric shapes for Span, which is especially costly for a type as new and evolving as Span.

### Could-it-be-done verdict

| Form | Viable? | Cost |
|------|---------|------|
| Self-carrier with default extension | Unverified; may fail `@_lifetime` requirement | Needs testing |
| Self-carrier with explicit `@_lifetime` | Yes | 4 explicit bodies, not one-liners |
| Parametric (Element-unwrap) | Yes, non-trivially | Array-family complications |

## Empirical update (2026-04-25)

`Experiments/span-carrier-conformance/` (V1–V4, CONFIRMED) settles concerns #1 and #3 with sharper findings than this document anticipated:

- **Concern #1 was right that the default doesn't apply, but for a different reason.** V1 REFUTED bare `extension Span: Carrier { typealias Underlying = Self }`. The failure isn't a `@_lifetime` mismatch on the witness body; it's that `extension Carrier where Underlying == Self` carries Self's default `Escapable` constraint and does not propagate `~Escapable`. The witness candidates are excluded from consideration entirely. Diagnostic: *"candidate would match if 'Span<Element>' conformed to 'Escapable'"*.
- **Concern #3 was correct.** V2 CONFIRMED that explicit witnesses work — `@_lifetime(borrow self) _read { yield self }` plus `@_lifetime(copy underlying) init(_ underlying: consuming Span<Element>) { self = underlying }`. Side finding: `borrowing get { self }` does NOT work for `~Escapable` Self (treated as a consume); `_read { yield self }` is required.
- **Cross-module + release pass.** V3 (cross-module generic dispatch) and V4 (release build) both CONFIRMED. Form-D generic algorithms compile and dispatch through Span correctly. A generic algorithm returning `C.Underlying` as a function result MUST add `where C.Underlying: Copyable` (the protocol's `Underlying: ~Copyable & ~Escapable` would otherwise reject the return as a `copy` of a noncopyable). Span is Copyable, so use sites for Span-of-T satisfy the constraint.

Concerns #2 (parametric "Span of a Carrier Pointee") and #4 (single-conformance lock for an evolving stdlib type) are NOT settled by the experiment; they remain considerations against parametric shapes and against premature centralization, but they do not block the trivial-self conformance that this document originally rejected.

## Outcome

**Status (revised 2026-04-25)**: DECISION — adopt trivial-self conformance for the four span types in 0.1.x SLI. Each conformance is an explicit ~5-line extension following the V2 shape; the Carrier+Trivial default extension is not used.

**Original status (2026-04-24)**: SKIP. Superseded by the empirical result above — the verification cost has been paid by the experiment, and the failure mode is now well-characterized rather than speculative.

**Conformance shape (per Span variant)**:

```swift
extension Span: Carrier {
    public typealias Underlying = Span<Element>

    public var underlying: Span<Element> {
        @_lifetime(borrow self)
        _read { yield self }
    }

    @_lifetime(copy underlying)
    public init(_ underlying: consuming Span<Element>) {
        self = underlying
    }
}
```

`MutableSpan`, `RawSpan`, `MutableRawSpan` follow the same shape with their own type substituted for `Span<Element>`.

**Open**: whether the Carrier+Trivial default extension should be loosened to cover `~Escapable` Self (a single relaxation that would obviate per-span explicit bodies). Out of scope for this document; track separately if the SLI grows additional `~Escapable` self-carriers.
